abstract = {Between 1999 and 2001, corrosion-related costs accounted for 3.1{\%} of the Gross Domestic Product (or {\$}276 billion a year) in the US. To minimize the economical loss requires accurately predicting and effectively preventing corrosion. Generally, corrosion is the deterioration of metal by its interaction with a combination of physical and chemical environments. Therefore, corrosion detection can be indirectly achieved by monitoring the accumulation of corrosion products or the physical or chemical changes they cause, e.g. appearance, acoustic and electromagnetic transmission, pH, etc. On the other hand, corrosion can be directly monitored by its electrochemical characteristics such as corrosion current, electrochemical noise, corrosion potential. Each of these corrosion monitoring techniques is worth its own fulfilled discussion. Instead of go through each techniques exhaustively, we will just give a general review of the major corrosion monitoring techniques across different research areas, with the intention of a contribution to the interdisciplinary research of corrosion monitoring techniques.},

abstract = {Seagoing vessels have to undergo regular visual inspections in order to detect defects such as cracks and cor- rosion before they result into catastrophic consequences. These inspections are currently performed manually by ship surveyors at a great cost, so that any level of assistance during the inspection process would significatively decrease the inspection cost. In this paper, we describe a novel framework for visually detecting the aforementioned defects. This framework is generic and flexible in the sense that it can be easily configured to compute the features that perform better for the inspection at hand. In this regard, inspired by the idea of conspicuity, this work considers contrast and symmetry as features for detecting defects on vessel structures. A combination operator is additionally tested in order to merge the information provided by these features and improve the detection performance. Experimental results for the different configurations of the detection framework show better classification results than state of the art methods.},

Additionally, there is a critical need to provide protection against sabotage activities, and to establish effective countermeasures against illegal smuggling activities. Unmanned underwater vehicles are suitable platforms for the development of automated inspection systems, but require integration with appropriate sensor technologies. This paper describes a vision system for automated ship-hull inspection, based on computing the necessary information for positioning, navigation, and mapping of the hull from stereo images. Binocular cues are critical in resolving a number of complex visual artifacts that hamper monocular vision in shallow-water conditions. Furthermore, they simplify the estimation of vehicle pose and motion, which is fundamental for successful automatic operation. The system has been implemented on a commercial remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and tested in pool and dock tests. Results from various trials are presented to demonstrate the system capabilities. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Computer vision-based techniques were developed to overcome the limitations of visual inspection by trained human resources and to detect structural damage in images remotely, but most methods detect only specific types of damage, such as concrete or steel cracks. To provide quasi real-time simultaneous detection of multiple types of damages, a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN)-based structural visual inspection method is proposed. To realize this, a database including 2,366 images (with 500 × 375 pixels) labeled for five types of damages—concrete crack, steel corrosion with two levels (medium and high), bolt corrosion, and steel delamination—is developed. Then, the architecture of the Faster R-CNN is modified, trained, validated, and tested using this database. Results show 90.6{\%}, 83.4{\%}, 82.1{\%}, 98.1{\%}, and 84.7{\%} average precision (AP) ratings for the five damage types, respectively, with a mean AP of 87.8{\%}. The robustness of the trained Faster R-CNN is evaluated and demonstrated using 11 new 6,000 × 4,000-pixel images taken of different structures. Its performance is also compared to that of the traditional CNN-based method. Considering that the proposed method provides a remarkably fast test speed (0.03 seconds per image with 500 × 375 resolution), a framework for quasi real-time damage detection on video using the trained networks is developed.},

Such work requires either manual approaches, which are slow and yield subjective results, or automated approaches, which depend upon complex handcrafted features. Yet, for the latter case, it is rarely known in advance which features are important for the problem at hand. In this paper, we propose a fully automated tunnel assessment approach; using the raw input from a single monocular camera we hierarchically construct complex features, exploiting the advantages of deep learning architectures. Obtained features are used to train an appropriate defect detector. In particular, we exploit a Convolutional Neural Network to construct high-level features and as a detector we choose to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron due to its global function approximation properties. Such an approach achieves very fast predictions due to the feedforward nature of Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Layer Perceptrons.},

Their failure can lead to train derailments due to gage widening or wheel climb, so their condition needs to be periodically monitored. Several computer vision methods have been proposed in the literature for track inspection applications. However, these methods are not robust to clutter and background noise present in the railroad environment. This paper proposes a new method for fastener detection by 1) carefully aligning the training data, 2) reducing intra-class variation, and 3) bootstrapping difficult samples to improve the classification margin. Using the histogram of oriented gradients features and a combination of linear SVM classifiers, the system described in this paper can inspect ties for missing or defective rail fastener problems with a probability of detection of 98{\%} and a false alarm rate of 1.23{\%} on a new dataset of 85 miles of concrete tie images collected in the US Northeast Corridor (NEC) between 2012 and 2013.

The reading rate of laser cameras to read up to 25.000 profiles per second is another important advantage provided in real time railway inspection.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 SPIE. Previously, we investigated the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect so-called Small Metallic Threats (SMTs) hidden amongst legitimate goods inside a cargo container. We trained a CNN from scratch on data produced by a Threat Image Projection (TIP) framework that generates images with realistic variation to robustify performance. The system achieved 90{\%} detection of containers that contained a single SMT, while raising 6{\%} false positives on benign containers. The best CNN architecture used the raw high energy image (single-energy) and its logarithm as input channels. Use of the logarithm improved performance, thus echoing studies on human operator performance. However, it is an unexpected result with CNNs. In this work, we (i) investigate methods to exploit material information captured in dual-energy images, and (ii) introduce a new CNN training scheme that generates {\^{a}}€spot-the-difference' benign and threat pairs on-the-fly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that CNNs have been applied directly to raw dual-energy X-ray imagery, in any field. To exploit dual-energy, we experiment with adapting several physics-derived approaches to material discrimination from the cargo literature, and introduce three novel variants. We hypothesise that CNNs can implicitly learn about the material characteristics of objects from the raw dual-energy images, and use this to suppress false positives. The best performing method is able to detect 95{\%} of containers containing a single SMT, while raising 0.4{\%} false positives on benign containers. This is a step change improvement in performance over our prior work.},

abstract = {A number of image processing techniques (IPTs) have been implemented for detecting civil infrastructure defects to partially replace human-conducted onsite inspections. These IPTs are primarily used to manipulate images to extract defect features, such as cracks in concrete and steel surfaces. However, the extensively varying real-world situations (e.g., lighting and shadow changes) can lead to challenges to the wide adoption of IPTs. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a vision-based method using a deep architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting concrete cracks without calculating the defect features. As CNNs are capable of learning image features automatically, the proposed method works without the conjugation of IPTs for extracting features. The designed CNN is trained on 40 K images of 256 × 256 pixel resolutions and, consequently, records with about 98{\%} accuracy. The trained CNN is combined with a sliding window technique to scan any image size larger than 256 × 256 pixel resolutions. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach are tested on 55 images of 5,888 × 3,584 pixel resolutions taken from a different structure which is not used for training and validation processes under various conditions (e.g., strong light spot, shadows, and very thin cracks). Comparative studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed CNN using traditional Canny and Sobel edge detection methods. The results show that the proposed method shows quite better performances and can indeed find concrete cracks in realistic situations.},

To enhance the efficiency of such an inspection, in recent years, autonomous damage detection based on computer vision has become a research hotspot. This article proposes a three-level image-based approach for post-disaster inspection of the reinforced concrete bridge using deep learning with novel training strategies. The convolutional neural network for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation are, respectively, proposed to conduct system-level failure classification, component-level bridge column detection, and local damage-level damage localization. To enable efficient training and prediction using a small data set, the model robustness is a crucial aspect to be taken into account, generally through its hyperparameters' selection. This article, based on Bayesian optimization, proposes a principled manner of such selection, with which very promising results (well over 90{\%} accuracies) and robustness are observed on all three-level deep learning models.},

abstract = {In recent years, deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has shown great efficacy for solving various vision tasks. In image segmentation, it has been demonstrated that a CNN can greatly outperform other approaches. However, special attention has to be paid towards setting various parameters in the CNN that affects the scale of the feature map generated at the last convolutional layer, where scale here refers to the ratio of the number of pixels in the original input image that correspond to each pixel in the feature map. Quite often, the optimal settings are tied to the specific problem on hand and can be fairly challenging to determine. To overcome such an issue, this paper proposes a multiscale Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) that combines networks trained at various scales, thereby allowing for conducting segmentation more generically. Moreover, such a multiscale architecture allows for incremental fine-tuning as more training images become available later on and new networks can be trained and added to the combined network. Such flexibility has great utility in applications such as industrial inspection, where training images may not be readily available initially, but yet requires a high level of accuracy. This paper will validate our findings by reporting the results that we have obtained by applying multiscale FCN to the inspection of aircraft engine part.},

Surface corrosion on aluminum aircraft skins, near joints and around fasteners, is often an indicator of buried structural corrosion and cracking In this paper we proposed a new method on which we are moving towards designing a method to detect the corrosion within the metals, the new method has defined texture analysis as the main method for this approach, the proposed enhancement shows less false positive and less false negative. The main functions used in this approach beside texture analysis are Edge detection, structure element and image dilation. The new approach has designed to detect a part of the image that has been affected by the corrosion, the tested images has showed a good result lying on detecting the corrosion part from the image.},

abstract = {The application of protective coatings is the primary method of protecting marine and offshore structures from corrosion. Coating breakdown and corrosion (CBC) assessment is a major aspect of coating failure management. Evaluation methods can result in unnecessary maintenance costs and a higher risk of failure. To achieve a comprehensive collection of data for CBC assessment, an unmanned arial system (UAS), assisted by the latest technological innovations, will be used to facilitate data collection in inaccessible locations. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based CBC assessment system is developed to provide objective assessment of the severity of coating failure. This method is more suitable for inspecting large areas by capturing and analyzing pictures/videos of the target area than the surveyor's existing manual inspection solution. In this paper, deep learning-based object detection in the CBC assessment system has been developed to provide an effective CBC assessment for the marine and offshore industries. By using active thermal imaging, it can identify corrosion behind the coating. This will greatly improve the efficiency and reliability of coating inspection. {\textcopyright} 2018 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems. All rights reserved.},

These inspections are currently performed manually by ship surveyors at a great cost, so that any level of assistance during the inspection process by means of e.g. a fleet of robots capable of defect detection would significatively decrease the inspection cost. In this paper, we describe a novel framework for visually detecting the aforementioned defects. This framework is generic and flexible in the sense that it can be easily configured to compute the features that perform better for the inspection at hand. Making use of this framework and inspired by the idea of conspicuity, this work considers contrast and symmetry as features for detecting defects and shows their usefulness for the case of vessels. Three different combination operators are additionally tested in order to merge the information provided by these features and improve the detection performance. Experimental results for different configurations of the detection framework show better classification rates than state of the art methods and prove its usability for images collected by a micro-aerial robotic platform intended for visual inspection.},

Through this quantization, it gives opportunity to not only manipulate the image but also detect a particular subject on the image as well, such as rust. Through setting the threshold values and the use of edge detection and segmentation, rusts on the image can be detected. The threshold values will set the parameters and characterize what a rust is. The edge detection will check for the sudden changes of colors in the images. The segmentation will then determine the colors on the image. The results in the edge detection and segmentation will be integrated to determine the rust on the image. The results of the program yield a success rate 90{\%} in detecting rust on images with rusts and did not obtain any errors on images with no rust.},

It has reportedly been recognised that such age-related deterioration is almost always involved in the catastrophic failures of ship structures including total losses. While such accidents typically cause concern to the public, maintenance and repair of aged structures is quite costly and complex. It is thus of great importance to develop advanced technologies allowing for proper management and control of such age-related deterioration. This paper summarises the report of the ISSC 2006 Committee V.6 presenting current practices, recent advances and future trends on condition assessment of aged ships. This includes assessment of the structural condition in view of the serviceability and safety, methods for repair, quantification of strength of deteriorated and repaired ships (as well as criteria for acceptable damage), with due account of the uncertainties involved. Consideration is also given to cost-benefit and risk-based decision procedures for remedial actions.},

For this, we created a dataset containing more than 140,000 optical images of pipelines with different levels of corrosion. A custom designed convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to classify the images of pipelines based on their corrosion level. This in-house fabricated CNN has very few parameters to be learned in comparison with the existing CNN classifiers. However, it produced significantly higher classification accuracy (98.8{\%}) with an ability to discriminate between images of corroded pipelines and images without corrosion but having patterns similar to corroded pipelines. The proposed network surpassed most of the state-of-the-art classifiers in its performance. In addition, we proposed a localisation algorithm based on a recursive region-based method, to selectively identify the corroded regions in a given image with higher precision. The proposed deep learning approach effectively wards off the need for manual inspection and other non-vision based non-destructive evaluation techniques for pipeline corrosion which are cost ineffective and interrupts the functioning of pipelines.},

abstract = {This paper presents an Acoustic Emission (AE) to detect pitting corrosion in stainless steel. The AE signals were analyzed to reveal the correlation between AE parameters and severity levels of pitting corrosion in austenitic stainless steel 304 (SS304). In this work, the corrosion severity is graded roughly into five levels based on the depth of corrosion. Relationships between a number of time-domain AE parameters and the corrosion severity were first studied and key parameters identified. The corrosion severity was also categorized into three stages: initial, propagation and final stages based on the source mechanisms of the AE signals. We identified these stages from the frequency-domain characteristic of the AE signal and the visual characteristic of the corroded pits in each level of corrosion severity. A number of measures were employed to quantify such characteristics and the source mechanisms hypothesized. To demonstrate the usefulness of such parameters, a feed-forward neural network was used to classify the corrosion severity. Preprocessing and verification techniques were provided to facilitate and to maintain the generalization capability of the network. The classification performance is excellent and demonstrates that the AE technique and a neural network can be efficiently used to detect and monitor the occurrence of corrosion as well as to classify the corrosion severity.},
